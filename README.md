## image-graph
Generates a nice graph showing the hierarchy of Docker images in your local
image cache.

Looks at all of the Docker image layers cached on the local system and
generates a PNG image showing the relationship of the various layers.

### Usage

The Ruby *image-graph* script is itself packaged as a Docker image so it can
easily be executed with the Docker *run* command:

    docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      centurylink/image-graph > docker_images.png

Since the script interacts with the Docker API in order to inspect your local
image cache it needs access to the Docker API socket. The `-v` flag shown above
makes the Docker socket available inside the container running the script.

The PNG that is generated is streamed to `stdout` so you'll need to redirect
the container's output to a file in order to save/view the generated image. The
name of the output file does not matter, but it is recommended that you use a
`.png` extension so that your image viewer will properly recognize the format of
the file.

### Example

Here's an example graph generated by this utility:

### FAQs

**How is this different than running `docker images --viz | dot -Tpng`?**

Actually, it's not different at all. The Ruby script executed by the image
essentially generates the same output that the `--viz` flag does and then pipes
it to the Graphviz *dot* tool to generate the graph.

**So, why do we need to execute a container when the same thing can be
achieved with a one-line Docker command?**

While this will work for some versions of Docker, the `--viz` flag has been
marked as deprecated and will likely be removed in some future release.

Additionally, my primary Docker environment is CoreOS which does not have
Graphviz installed and provides no way for me to install it myself -- in
an environment like this, the only option is to run Graphviz inside a
container.
